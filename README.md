# wiggle-mouse

A short utility to wiggle the mouse to prevent screensavers (when lacking admin access to disable the screensaver)


## Usage

Double-click `wiggle_mouse.exe` to start. Close the console or hit Ctrl-C to stop.

You can copy and paste the executable anywhere you want or make any arbitrary shortcuts to it. Make sure to copy the config file along with it! 

If the program cannot find a config file, it will auto-generate a new one.

The source code has been included for reference only -- it doesn't actually do anything.
